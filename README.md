This is a synthetic data generator for corporate bond transaction costs (bid/ask spreads). The idea behind this was that TCs (transaction costs) are driven by a number of factors such as rating, trade lot size, industry, and so on, on top of a 'base' cost. I modelled 5 different factors, where each factor is its own Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as I wanted TCs to ultimately be mean-reverting, which is what current research tends to support. Each OU process is also correlated, as factors tend to be correlated with each other in the real-world. I should note however, that the means/vols that I use as well as the correlation matrix are totally made up; I don't actually have empirically determined values. The point of this project was not to create a data generator for real-world use, but just as a fun project for myself.
